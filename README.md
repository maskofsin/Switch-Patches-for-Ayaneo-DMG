ATTENTION!

This is an attempt to convert widescreen patches created by @Fl4sh9174 to 8:7 or 1240x1080 - which is the Ayaneo DMG (and Retroid Classic) aspect ratio and screen resolution.

These were converted with python scripts, so expect some of them to not work correctly.

I only tried to mess with resolution and widescreen patches folders. Other patches like fps and level of detailed I tried to let them as they were.

If you have a fix or a new patched game please let me know.

Again, I take no ownership on these patches. 

Please support Fl4sh9174 if you want to.


Below is the original README from Fl4sh9174 (https://github.com/Fl4sh9174/Switch-Ultrawide-Mods)





"Inside the .zip files, you'll find:

Ultrawide mods (adjusted HUD when possible)
FPS mods (60FPS, 120FPS, 240FPS, etc., depending on the game)
Resolution mods, up to 8K+
And much more!
To install the mods:

On Yuzu/Eden/Citron/Ryujinx/KenjiNX:

Right-click on the game for which you want to install the mod. Open the mod data location. Extract the zip file there.

On Ryujinx:

Right-click on the game for which you want to install the mod. Open the mods data directory. Extract the zip file there.

After extracting the mods, you can select which mod you want to enable or disable on both emulators.

On Switch you can convert the files to IPS when necessary.

I will always try to add up to 4K/8K resolution when possible. Mods are optimized for a resolution of 3440x1440. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.

All the files inside mods folder are necessary, some mods contains cheats file, pchtxt file and V2.pchtxt files, dont delete any of these. If you encounter any issues with the mods, please let me know.

All mods are free, but if you want to support me: https://ko-fi.com/Fl4sh9174
